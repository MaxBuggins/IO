There are a few strategies you can try mid fall, to stop yourself from falling.

    1. Try to remain calm and think clearly. Falling can be a scary and disorienting experience, but it's important to stay calm and focused in order to come up with a plan to stop your fall.

    2. Look for something to grab onto. If you are falling from a height, look for something to grab onto, such as a railing, tree branch, or other protrusion. This can help you slow or stop your fall. NEVER TRY TO STOP ALL AT ONCE OR YOU WILL DIE INSTANTLY, IT MAY TAKE MINUITES TO SLOW YOUR FALL.

    3. Try to control your body position. If you are falling through the air, dont point down like a dive, spread your arms, legs and close your fingers.

    Bonus Steps, may not be possible.

    4. Deploy a parachute (if you have one). If you are falling from a very high altitude, such as while skydiving, you may have a parachute that you can use to slow your descent. Make sure you are properly trained on how to use your parachute before attempting to deploy it.

    5. Use a fall arrest system (if you have one). If you are working at a height and have a fall arrest system in place, make sure you are properly connected to it before beginning your work. If you do fall, the system should arrest your fall and keep you from hitting the ground.
